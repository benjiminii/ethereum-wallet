This is a [Next.js, Express, MongoDB](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with

First, install the dependancies.
I used "bun" but any other runtime will work.

```bash
bun run postinstall
```

Then run backend and frontend servers separetly

```bash
bun run frontend
```

```bash
bun run backend
```

I know it is a bad idea to leave you .env variables. But if it seems not be working please use these variables or contact me.

```bash
PORT=5555
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://benjiminii:t19Bygj77H01%40@cluster0.unzli3v.mongodb.net/ethereum-wallet?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
