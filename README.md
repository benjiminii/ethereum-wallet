This is a Next.js, Express, MongoDB project.

First, install the dependancies.
I used "bun" but any other runtime will work.

```bash
bun run postinstall
```

Then run backend and frontend servers separetly

```bash
bun run frontend
```

```bash
bun run backend
```

If it seems not be working please contact me.

```bash
PORT=5555
```
